Project Description :

This mini-project consists of developing a photo gallery that allows users to add and display images through a secure form.
The main objective is to apply the fundamental concepts of web development, particularly the manipulation of Views, Routes, and Controllers, form validation, and data transfer between the different layers of the application.
This project is carried out in a learning and academic context.

Learning Objectives :
Understand the MVC architecture (Model – View – Controller)
Manipulate routes to manage navigation
Create dynamic views
Implement a form with validation
Ensure data transfer between the controller and the views

Structure a web project in a professional manner :
Main Features |
Display of a photo gallery |
Data submission through a  |
Field validation (title, image, description, etc.) |
Management of error and success messages |
Data transmission between Controllers and Views |
Navigation using defined routes 

Route Management :
Routes are used to link URLs to their corresponding controllers.

Controllers :
The controller is responsible for:
Retrieving data
Validating form inputs
Sending data to the views
Handling errors

Views :
Views are responsible for:
Displaying the photo gallery
Displaying the form
Showing messages (errors / success)
They receive data from the controller.

Form Validation :
Form validation allows:
Ensuring that all required fields are filled
Checking the image type and size
Preventing the submission of invalid data
In case of an error, a clear message is displayed to the user.

Data Transfer :
Data is transferred:
From the form to the Controller
From the Controller to the Views
This mechanism ensures a clear separation of responsibilities.

Technologies Used :
HTML5 CSS3 PHP (MVC architecture)
